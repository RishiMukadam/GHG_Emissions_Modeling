# 🌱 GHG Emissions Modeling Project

This project predicts supply chain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using U.S. industry and commodity data from 2010–2016.

## 📁 Structure
- `data/`: Raw + combined data
- `src/`: Python scripts for preprocessing and modeling
- `notebooks/`: Final notebook
- `README.md`: This file
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages

## 🚀 Model Results
Both Random Forest and Linear Regression were trained and evaluated using RMSE and R² metrics.

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Install requirements:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook:  
   `jupyter notebook notebooks/01_ghg_modeling.ipynb`
